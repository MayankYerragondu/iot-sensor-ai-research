# Smart Home IoT Anomaly Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores **personalized anomaly detection models** for smart home IoT environments.  
It focuses on **PIR motion sensors**, **contact alarms**, and **environmental sensors** (temperature, humidity, luminance) to reduce **false alarms** in intrusion detection systems.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Device-specific anomaly detection models for PIR sensors  
- Contact alarm anomaly detection using temporal patterns + One-Class SVM  
- Multivariate forecasting for environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, luminance)  
- Modular AWS pipeline with Glue, SageMaker, Step Functions, and Terraform  
- Scalable architecture supporting both **real-time (MongoDB)** and **historical (S3)** data
